1. The biggest issue with this is that the maze layout is not randomized which lowers the replay value drastically.
    - The fix for this would result in a complete overhaul of pathing system for the labryinth, which would cause issues over the whole project.
    - Perhaps make several maps for the labryinth to take, as it will have more replayablility value with the random room generator
