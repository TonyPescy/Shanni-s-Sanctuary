## Known Issues
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
1. The biggest issue with this is that the room layout is not randomized at all which lowers the replay value drastically.
    - The fix for this would result in a complete overhaul of pathing system for the labryinth, which would cause issues over the whole project.
