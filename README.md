## Known Issues
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
1. The biggest issue with this is that the maze layout is not randomized which lowers the replay value drastically.
    - The fix for this would result in a complete overhaul of pathing system for the labryinth, which would cause issues over the whole project.
    - Perhaps make several maps for the labryinth to take, as it will have more replayablility value along with the random room generator.
1. Repeated Code and Use of Inefficient Code Practices
    - The fix for this is optimizing and creating more functions to reduce code reuse, updating code practices etc...
    - The cause of this is learning more efficient ways to solve certain problems as I programmed leading to new practices being used as I wrote and older code still being outdated.
    - The solution will be implemented for this later after a working product has been produced as the possible performance issues of these bad practices should be negliable due to the smaller nature of the game. These issues are noted and currently being worked on.
1. Game Balance
    - Currently all game numbers have yet to be tested thoroughly enough so there may be issues of the game being too difficult and therefore not fun. The game is meant to be a bit challenging but should still be fair and enjoyable for the player.
    - The fix for this is more testing and most likely nerfing the enemy stats, giving the player starting potions, giving the player buffs in and out of combat, and changing some rooms to give player more chances to avoid damage or status effects
