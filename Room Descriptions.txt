1 The aroma of wet dirt and clay punches you in the face as you enter the room.  Starting at your feet and reaching the ceiling, colorful flowers and dark vines interwinded with one another form almost a homogeneous wall of foliage.  In the center of the room stands, rooted to everything around it, what appears to be an overgrown Venus Flytrap with a razor sharp teeth dripping with a green ooze.  It opens its mouth as if to swallow you whole.
2 This room sounds quiet as you enter, only the sound of your soft footsteps can be heard echoing up through the chamber which seemed to go up endlessly.  Feathers dust the floor you walk upon ranging in colors of red, blue, and yellow.  Looking up, you try to dash towards a door, but slip on the feathers as the sound of wings descend upon you.
3 Bones litter the floor, crunching beneath your boots as you slowly make your way through the chamber.  Before you even get half way the bones begin sliding towards one another, guided by a dull yellow glow.  A rusted sword flys past your face, nicking your ear before it is caught in the skeletal hand.
4 As you enter the room there is a low rattle and a slight glint in the distance.  The glint grows and grows as the arrow closes in on you but falls short, skittering to your feet.  Then that rattle started again.
5 You step into the room, splashing in the ankle high water that soaks your boots.  Your anger subsides quickly when your eyes meet hers.  Unlike anything else in this sanctuary she is anything but decrepit; her eyes are full of fire, her skin is tinged blue, and her hair falls in waves covering just enough of her body.  She looks at you and smiles, holding out her hand to you.  She begins to sing a song like none you have ever heard, her serenade warms you and eggs you forth.  It pulls you in like a fish on a hook.  
6 A string lay at you feet and led deeper into the chamber.  It led you around winding walls and corridors.  Had someone been here before you and mapped out this room to help those who get trapped as well?  It can't be, why was there only string in this room?  Your mind racing with the possiblilty of there being someone else who was trapped here with you, didn't even notice the walking mountain of muscle until you were right on top of it.  It towered over you with its half-man and half-bull body, looking at you with its lifeless brown eyes.  You stumble backwards as it lowers its head and prepares to gorge you on its horns.
7 As you enter the chamber braziers lining the walls instantly ignite, filling the room with light.  Before you is a mountain of corpses, but one is moving crawling through the death and despair. He struggled to his feet, his armor a mess of dents and coated in a thick slimy layer of blood fell down beside him. He grabbed his fallen chestplate, raising it like a shield after he bowed to you.
8 In the center of the sandy room, sat atop a pedestal of gold was a golden box adorned with gemstones of all colors.  It shook as you walked up to it, rumbling and shaking side to side until the lid popped off to the side.  A thin hand sprouted from the sarcophagus.  Then came the thin body wrapped from head to toe, the creature leaped from the pedestal and let out a feral growl as its glowing green eyes met yours. 
9 The light from this room was almost blinding.  It came from a large fire that sat in the center of the room with a spit with an entire horse skewered on it.  The loud roar was enough to leave you with a splitting headache and the stomping shook the floor beneath you.  Smalls rocks fell from the walls and ceiling as if an earthquake had just hit.  You met the creatures large blue eye, again it roared though this time it pulled at one of the several pillars scattered throughout the room.  Eventually it yanked the pillar from its spot and fell back with another crash.  Its fat rippled as it stood up and hobbled towards you, drooling and licking its lips.
10 You enter the well lit chamber, the grass and walls made it seem like you were outside in a fancy garden or courtyard.  Across the way a man with wavy brown hair and a tudor with a feather smiled at you.  His clothes were spotless but horribly dated.  He drew his rapier from his hip and flicked another one from his feet to yours.  He motioned with his sword to pick it up as he grabbed his buckler.
11 As you enter the chamber, a banging can be heard.  It gets louder and louder as you go deeper in.  Eventually you find the source of it, at the end of chamber there was a desk covered with all kinds of scrolls, herbs, bottles you can only imagine to be potions, and various gems.  On the other side of the far wall was the source of the banging; hunched over a brown robe that sat in a red slurry was a stone man-like creature with boulders for hands.  It had a slight blue glow about it.  It turned away from the slurry and turned towards you, its face had no detail and was covered in blood.  It raised its fists as it lumbered over to you.
12 As you enter the chamber braziers lining the walls instantly ignite, filling the room with light.  Before you is a mountain of corpses, maybe those who had come before you?  Or were they there since this sanctuary came to be?  You couldn't dwell on the possibilities as a figure rose from a throne atop the mountain.  The man in bloody armor slowly descended towards you, with each step his armor screeched and ground on itself.  The armor, black with grim and old blood, held together by glowing blue thread as he lifted his weapon to you.  Then he bowed before you, revealing a red cloak with a sigil of howling wolf.  You readied yourself as he stood back up and raised his shield in front of his body.
13 The doors open up to what seemed to be a cross between a library and training grounds. One side full of books, herbs, and scrolls of gods know what and the other full of tattered training dummies and a being that hacked away at them with a glowing purple spear. They took notice of you, raising their armor out and summoning a purple shield to their free hand. 
14 As the chamber opened up blood seeped out to your shoes. Stepping carefully through the muck you realize the walls were coated in blood and viscera and in the center of the room was a burning red portal. Before you could investigate a figure too large to be human flew through the portal on its scarlet wings. Matching its wings was its plate armor that left no weakpoints exposed and its helmet were adorned with blackened horns. In its left hand was a shield as tall as you and in its other a sword larger than any other you had seen. The red metal matching the armor and this hellish chamber.
15 Maps were strewn about the room and walls. They were of no place you knew, they seemed to be a map of a maze. Scrolls and papers were all over the floor aswell, the closest to you read the date: 15. Januar 1943... Before you could continue two men dressed in gray-green tunics jumped out at you from the darkness.
16 This room was tiny, just four plain walls not more than 4 feet away from each other. It was like being in an elevator. You felt around the walls until a stone felt off, lighter and loose compared to the rest. Once pressed the wall before vanished leading you into a hidden library of sorts. The air got heavy and felt difficult to walk through. As you pressed onwards you found dusty manuscripts and ancient scrolls and among them a woman reading from a scroll. As you approached blue shards of pure energy were launched towards you.
17 The door opened up into a modern apartment room. It even had a view of the city, a view you knew too well. Your eyes darted back and forth around the room finding the familiar messy desk and well stocked bookshelves. It even had the chair with your laundry on it. Then it appeared, a direct copy of you shrouded and distorted in black, but you could see the wicked smile spread across that familiar face.
18 As you enter the thick mist hit you face, it was refreshing. As was the soft moss and trees that surrounded the small pond covered in the center of the chamber. As you appraoched the scum covered pond an enormous toad emerged from the muck.
19 The barking was heard from outside the chamber, they become more and more ferocious as you approached. Once you saw them, the black beasts with rows of sharp teeth and a fiery red coat of fur. If it were not for where you were they would have seemed cute, but here you could see the demons behind them. Smell the scent of sulfur and brimstone from their hot breath. You hurried towards the exit, but the chains that held one of them back was yanked from the wall. As it bounded towards you, you hoped and prayed that the other one would not be able to break free.
20 The chamber opened up to an orante room filled with lit braziers and a mountain of gold, silver, and various other riches. Atop this mound of treasure was a large ruby lizard with small wings. Upon seeing you it jumped down from the mountain and strectched out its wings while hissing at you.
21 A sinister, glowing green floor pulsates with an eerie light, its surface slick with a bubbling, viscous poison that seeps through cracks and pools in ominous rivulets. Toxic fumes waft upward, shimmering in the air, as the ooze seems almost alive, spreading its poisonous touch across the cursed ground.
22 The ancient tomb was shrouded in shadows, its stone walls etched with fading hieroglyphs. The floor is scattered with pressure switches, worn smooth by time, yet deceptively sensitive. Each misstep triggers hidden mechanisms, unleashing a barrage of glowing green darts from concealed slits in the walls. The faint sound of grinding gears and the whoosh of projectiles echo in the darkness.
23 The doorway opened out to a fortified courtyard surrounded by towering stone walls. Archers line the battlements, their silhouettes stark against the sky as they draw and release in unison, launching volley after volley of arrows into the center of the room.
24 The dense jungle formed around you, the ground is uneven, covered in scattered leaves and vines that deceptively conceal sharpened wooden spikes jutting from hidden pits. The humid air is thick with the scent of earth and decay as if even the air itslef in here is attempting to choke you.
25 The grand library room stretches out in elegant symmetry, its towering shelves crafted from rich mahogany and filled with rows of pristine books, their spines gleaming in soft golden lettering. The air carries the faint scent of parchment and polished wood. Delicate chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceiling, casting a warm, ambient glow that highlights the intricate carvings along the walls. A close by desk has a open book sat upon it, it is coated in a shimmering blue aura.
26 A dense forest room bathed in dappled sunlight feels alive with tension. Towering trees with thick, knotted roots surround the space, their leafy canopy casting shifting shadows on the mossy ground. Among the foliage your foot catches something and ropes groan as the log suspended from them is freed. The log smashes into you, sending you deeper into the forest. Dirt coats you as you lay there among the ferns listening to the birds that sing solemn songs. After a while you stand up and stumble to the end of the forest.
27 A shimmering magical seal radiates an otherworldly glow, its intricate runes and glyphs etched into the air itself, pulsing with a rhythmic hum. Swirling colors—ochre, sulfur, and soot—intertwine in an endless loop, forming a complex sigil that seems almost alive. The air around it feels charged, crackling and giving off a faint warmth. You push the door open to squeeze through, though once the door crosses over the sigil the room is filled with fire and concussive blast that launches you into the door. When you awake the room is nothing but ash and scattered flickering flames. It is a miracle you survived the blast.
28 A dimly lit stone chamber exudes an air of silent menace, its uneven floor dotted with ancient carvings worn smooth by use. One step into the roomputs you atop a trap door, its edges barely visible beneath you. A faint metallic creak echoes ominously throughout the room, and before you dive away the trapdoor snaps open revealing a writhing pit below teeming with snakes of all sizes, their scales glistening in the faint light that filters through. Hisses and the occasional rattle rise from the darkness, as fangs glint, ready to strike the unfortunate soul who has fallen into their domain.
29 A stark, silent room stretches out before you, its smooth stone walls and floor devoid of decoration or furniture. The emptiness amplifies the faint sound of your footsteps, each echo lingering in the oppressive stillness. At the far end of the room stands a solitary door, its surface adorned with no handle or keyhole, only two buttons embedded in the wall beside it—one glowing faintly red and the other blue. The air feels heavy with anticipation, as if the room itself is holding its breath, waiting for a choice to be made.
30 The room is a towering, perilous chamber of stone. A narrow, weathered walkway of bricks stretches across the room, suspended above a deep, foreboding pit shrouded in darkness. On either side of the walkway, colossal, deadly pendulum blades swing rhythmically, their razor-sharp edges gleaming faintly in the dim light. You dash past the first two and attempt to roll past the last one. It cuts deep into your shoulder but you manage to roll beyond it without falling off.
31 A grand, cavernous room exudes an aura of age and mystique, its walls carved from rough stone and adorned with faded etchings of forgotten legends. At its center lies a raised pedestal of weathered rock, illuminated by a beam of light cascading from a crack in the ceiling above. Embedded deep within the pedestal is an ancient sword, its blade gleaming faintly despite the passing centuries. The hilt is adorned with intricate patterns of gold and silver, encrusted with small, glimmering gemstones that pulse faintly as if alive. The sword seems to call to you, as though awaiting the one destined to free it from its eternal prison.
32 The room is dimly lit, with the glow of flickering torches casting dancing shadows across the walls. At the center stands a polished glass display case on a stone pedestal, encasing a set of immaculate plate armor. The armor gleams with a metallic sheen, its surface untouched by rust or wear, as if preserved by some unseen force. Intricate engravings of swirling patterns and heraldic symbols adorn the breastplate, hinting at its noble origins.
33 The room is small yet brimming with character, its walls lined with shelves crafted from dark, aged wood. Each shelf is packed with glass jars and bottles of varying shapes and sizes, their contents a vibrant array of powders, liquids, and herbs. Bundles of dried plants hang from the ceiling beams, their earthy aromas mingling in the air. A wooden counter, scarred with years of use, occupies the center of the room, its surface cluttered with mortar and pestles, scales, and small tools for grinding and mixing. The flickering glow of a single lantern casts a warm light over the space, highlighting a dusty tome left open on the counter, its pages filled with handwritten recipes and alchemical diagrams.
34 The room is dimly lit, the faint glow of tallow candles casting flickering shadows across the rough stone walls. The air is thick with the metallic scent of blood and the acrid aroma of herbal poultices. A single wooden bed stands in the center of the room, its straw-filled mattress soaked with dark, dried blood that stains the coarse linen sheets. Beside it, a crude wooden table holds an assortment of tools: rusty saws, forceps, and bloodied rags alongside bowls filled with murky water and remnants of hastily prepared remedies.
35 The room is stark and desolate, its stone walls bare and cold, save for the faint marks and outlines where racks and weapons once hung. Dust coats the floor in a thin layer, undisturbed except for a few scattered footprints, hinting at long-forgotten activity. The faint smell of oil and metal lingers in the air, a ghostly remnant of its former purpose. Empty weapon racks and armor stands sit abandoned, their wood warped and splintered with age.
36 The tower is a solitary, spiraling structure perched high above a desolate landscape. The circular chamber at the top is lined with tall, arched windows that frame the grim view beyond. Outside, a lifeless forest stretches into the distance, its twisted, leafless trees clawing at the ashen sky. Beyond the forest lies a scorched wasteland, where fiery cracks in the earth spew smoke and molten lava, casting an ominous orange glow over the horizon.
37 The treasure room glimmers with a golden glow, its stone walls reflecting the light of flickering torches mounted in intricate holders. Piles of coins, sparkling gems, and gilded relics are heaped across the floor, creating an almost overwhelming display of opulence. At the center of the room, elevated on a polished marble pedestal, rests an ornate shield of extraordinary craftsmanship. Its massive surface is engraved with intricate patterns of swirling vines and mythological creatures, highlighted with inlays of silver and gold. A large gemstone, deep crimson and pulsating faintly, is embedded in its center.
38 The cave is dim and damp, its walls rough and jagged, illuminated only by the faint light filtering through cracks in the stone. In one corner, a crude makeshift desk has been assembled from uneven planks of wood, propped up on loose stones. Scattered across its surface are remnants of hurried activity: a burnt-down candle stub, scraps of torn parchment, and a simple inkpot tipped on its side, leaving a dark stain. Among the clutter lies a hastily written note, its words scrawled in uneven handwriting as if penned in great urgency. The paper is smudged and creased, its message fully illegible.
39 The apothecary is a cozy, dimly lit room brimming with the scents of herbs, spices, and mysterious concoctions. Wooden shelves line the walls, packed with glass jars of dried leaves, powdered minerals, and colorful liquids. Bundles of lavender, rosemary, and other plants dangle from the ceiling beams, adding to the earthy aroma. A sturdy oak counter, scarred from years of mixing and grinding, sits at the center, its surface cluttered with mortar and pestles, parchment recipes, and a scale for precise measurements.
40 The room opened up into an ancient library with towering shelves filled with old, dusty books. In the center of the room, a large glass case stands, illuminated by the soft glow of a nearby lantern. Inside the case, nestled on a velvet cushion, is an ornate scroll with intricate, gold-leafed designs. The scroll is labeled in bold, elegant lettering: "Emergency Use Only".

51 As you walk through the short hallway the heavy doors slam shut behind you. Slowly your eyes adjust to the dim light revealing weathered stone brick covered with thick vines and wet moss. As you scan the room there is nothing that you can see and the doors behind you won't budge. There won't be any turning back now, the only way is through the thick wooden doors before you.
