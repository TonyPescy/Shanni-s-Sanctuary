The aroma of wet dirt and clay punches you in the face as you enter the room.  Starting at your feet and reaching the ceiling, colorful flowers and dark vines interwinded with one another form almost a homogeneous wall of foliage.  In the center of the room stands, rooted to everything around it, what appears to be an overgrown Venus Flytrap with a razor sharp teeth dripping with a green ooze.  It opens its mouth as if to swallow you whole.
This room sounds quiet as you enter, only the sound of your soft footsteps can be heard echoing up through the chamber which seemed to go up endlessly.  Feathers dust the floor you walk upon ranging in colors of red, blue, and yellow.  Looking up, you try to dash towards a door, but slip on the feathers as the sound of wings descend upon you.
Bones litter the floor, crunching beneath your boots as you slowly make your way through the chamber.  Before you even get half way the bones begin sliding towards one another, guided by a dull yellow glow.  A rusted sword flys past your face, nicking your ear before it is caught in the skeletal hand.
As you enter the room there is a low rattle and a slight glint in the distance.  The glint grows and grows as the arrow closes in on you but falls short, skittering to your feet.  Then that rattle started again.
You step into the room, splashing in the ankle high water that soaks your boots.  Your anger subsides quickly when your eyes meet hers.  Unlike anything else in this sanctuary she is anything but decrepit; her eyes are full of fire, her skin is tinged blue, and her hair falls in waves covering just enough of her body.  She looks at you and smiles, holding out her hand to you.  She begins to sing a song like none you have ever heard, her serenade warms you and eggs you forth.  It pulls you in like a fish on a hook.  
A string lay at you feet and lead deeper into the chamber.  It leads around winding walls and corridors.  Had someone been here before you and mapped out this room to help those who get trapped as well?  It can't be, why was there only string in this room?  Your mind racing with the possiblilty of there being someone else who was trapped here with you, didn't even notice the walking mountain of muscle until you were right on top of it.  It towered over you with its half-man and half-bull body, looking at you with its lifeless brown eyes.  You stumble backwards as it lowers its head and prepares to gorge you on its horns.
As you enter the chamber braziers lining the walls instantly egnite, filling the room with light.  Before you is a mountain of corpses, maybe those who had come before you?  Or were they there since this sanctuary came to be?  You couldn't dwell on the possibilities as a figure rose from a throne atop the mountain.  The man in dirty armor slowly descended towards you, with each step his armor screeched and ground on itself.  The armor, black with grim and old blood, barely held itself together as he lifted his weapon to you.  Then he bowed before you, revealing a red cloak with a sigil of howling wolf.  You readied yourself as he stood back up and raised his shield in front of his body.
In the center of the sandy room, sat atop a pedestal of gold was a golden box adorned with gemstones of all colors.  It shook as you walked up to it, rumbling and shaking side to side until the lid popped off to the side.  A thin hand sprouted from the sarcophagus.  Then came the thin body wrapped from head to toe, the creature leaped from the pedestal and let out a feral growl as its glowing green eyes met yours. 
The light from this room was almost blinding.  It came from a large fire that sat in the center of the room with a spit with an entire horse skewered on it.  The loud roar was enough to leave you with a splitting headache and the stomping shook the floor beneath you.  Smalls rocks fell from the walls and ceiling as if an earthquake had just hit.  You met the creatures large blue eye, again it roared though this time it pulled at one of the several pillars scattered throughout the room.  Eventually it yanked the pillar from its spot and fell back with another crash.  Its fat rippled as it stood up and hobbled towards you, drooling and licking its lips.
You enter the well lit chamber, the grass and walls made it seem like you were outside in a fancy garden or courtyard.  Across the way a man with wavy brown hair and a tudor with a feather smiled at you.  His clothes were spotless but horribly dated.  He drew his rapier from his hip and flicked another one from his feet to yours.  He motioned with his sword to pick it up as he grabbed his buckler.
As you enter the chamber, a banging can be heard.  It gets louder and louder as you go deeper in.  Eventually you find the source of it, at the end of chamber there was a desk covered with all kinds of scrolls, herbs, bottles you can only imagine to be potions, and various gems.  On the other side of the far wall was the source of the banging; hunched over a brown robe that sat in a red slurry was a stone man-like creature with boulders for hands.  It had a slight blue glow about it.  It turned away from the slurry and turned towards you, its face had no detail and was covered in blood.  It raised its fists as it lumbered over to you.

As you walk through the short hallway the heavy doors slam shut behind you. Slowly your eyes adjust to the dim light revealing weathered stone brick covered with thick vines and wet moss. As you scan the room there is nothing that you can see and the doors behind you won't budge. There won't be any turning back now, the only way is through the thick wooden doors before you.
